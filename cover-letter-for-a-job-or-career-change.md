## Cover Letter Example

```
In my earlier career I tended to use maths, statistics and the limited amount of IT available. Nowadays, more than ever, I have missed opportunities to learn and use modern technology to streamline my work. Therefore, I decided to take my chances and start a new career in IT which I think aligns well with my personality and preferences. 

I bring a passion for problem solving. I enjoy challenging problems and at the same time I like to do a good job and not stop halfway. I believe it will pay off in the end, just like the project I worked hard on at Syngenta that ended up winning the company award.

I recently took a leave to get the education needed to start my new career. It was amazing to gain so much new knowledge. But I'm not going to end here. I have a strong desire to improve my skills and further expand my knowledge to excel in a new job.
